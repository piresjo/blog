During the day, I am a software engineer. However, whenever I have the time, I dabble in writing. In the past, I wrote about tech, video gaming, pop culture, and international politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New content will come soon (probably by early December).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><summary type="html">For those interested for some reason, my name is Joe.
