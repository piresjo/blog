For those interested for some reason, my name is Joe. During the day, I am a software engineer. However, whenever I have the time, I dabble in writing. In the past, I wrote about tech, video gaming, pop culture, and international politics.

Over the past couple years, work has been taking up a lot of my time, and it has been a while since I wrote extensively. Now I have some free time to write, so this blog might see a lot more action in the near future. For now, though, I will be uploading my old articles.

New content will come soon (probably by early December).
